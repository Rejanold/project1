    Critique from client:
    <p>
      Based on the availability of information the website has developed into a very nice entry level site. The five (5)
      tab choices allow for the future development/growth of information in different categories. The main "header"
      picture follows through all 5 tabs. This works, but depending on the size of the picture, makes it slightly
      difficult for the viewer to know if they have switch tabs without scrolling down for information. The main picture
      is also "cut off" causing the top and bottom to be lost. While that normally may not be a big deal, in this
      business situation the "Pale" is the sharpen wooden fences and should be fully visible. On the "about us" section,
      I think it would have given the page a more balanced look if the story verbiage could have started at the same
      height as the picture, then continued full screen. I really like the fact the site view (I have) "fits the screen"
      and does not require scrolling from right to left in order to see the information. Overall, I am very pleased with
      the layout, the information options and consider this a success!
