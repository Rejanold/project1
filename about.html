        <p>The English Pale was a strip of land, centered on the City of Dublin and became the base of English rule in
          Ireland during the Medieval Ages. By the late 15th century, the area known as “The Pale” became the only part
          of Ireland that remained under the control of the English. The word pale, meaning a fence, is derived from
          Latin, meaning "stake", specifically a stake used to support a fence. The defenses of the Pale, in Ireland
          included a ditch with thorn bushes and a Pale (fence).</p>
          <p>
          The English Crown (king) attempted to assert its authority over the settlers, offered English Lords and
          knights money to move and construct “Tower Houses” in Ireland. The Crown also forbid intermarriage between
          English settlers and Irish natives. It also outlawed the English subjects from using and speaking the Irish
          language and adopting Irish modes of dress or other customs. The Anglo-Norman setters adopted Irish traits so
          strongly that the term, <b><i>"More Irish than the Irish themselves"</i></b> became a saying to describe this unlawful
          behavior.</p>
          <p>
          The phrase <b><i>"Beyond</i></b> (or outside) <b><i>the pale"</i></b>, describes something outside the boundary, or in other-words, to be
          uncivilized or outside the bounds of morality, acceptable behavior or good judgement, etc. If you are “Within
          the pale”, it would be just the opposite.</p>
          <p>
          So here we are, after serving “the authority” for 39+ years we packed our things and moved to a piece of
          boundary land on the Black River near Melrose, in Jackson County, Wisconsin. We reside in the Manor which also
          hosts our Irish Pub and we became <b><i>"More Irish than the Irish themselves"</i></b>. For our travelling guests we have 20
          camping spots near the Manor, on the hill and other 5 rustic camping spots along the river. We are a licensed
          establishment so all guests to any part of the property, must be 21 years and older (Government ID required).</p>
          <p>
          Come visit the boundaries of the Pale and see if you become "<b><i>More Irish than the Irish themselves</i></b> and are you
          <b><i>"Beyond the pale"</i></b> or <b><i>"Within the pale"</i></b>? The choice is yours,</p>
         <p>
          <b>Welcome, mates.</b>
        </p>
         <p> Plans for the future devolopment of this website include: a function for booking,
          weather related information
          and an interactive map of the campground.</p>
